Human Face & Posture Detector
🚀 AI-Powered Real-Time Face & Posture Detection Using Mediapipe & OpenCV

This project is a real-time face and body posture detection system that utilizes MediaPipe Holistic, OpenCV, and Machine Learning to track facial landmarks, hand movements, and full-body posture. It is designed for applications in gesture recognition, physical therapy, fitness tracking, and human-computer interaction.

The system processes live webcam input, extracts face and pose landmarks, and applies machine learning models to classify body language, emotions, or gestures. With OpenCV-based visualization, users can see the detected landmarks in real time with probability-based classification results.

🔹 Key Features
✅ Real-Time Face & Posture Detection – Uses a webcam to analyze facial landmarks and body posture.
✅ AI-Powered Gesture Recognition – Predicts body language, emotions, and gestures using trained machine learning models.
✅ Pose & Face Landmark Extraction – Saves detailed body posture data in a CSV file for further AI model training.
✅ Machine Learning Model Training – Uses Scikit-Learn classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
✅ Live OpenCV Visualizations – Overlays detected landmarks and classification probabilities on the video feed.
✅ Deployment Ready – The project supports Flask & Streamlit for web-based AI applications.
